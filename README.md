This is a really mediocre pong clone I made as a effort to learn how to program the 6502 and the Apple II   
It runs in low res graphics mode and has sound even. It should run on most Apple IIs as it's a very small game.
I used the DASM assembler so please use that to compile it.   
I also want to thank the 8BITWORKSHOP ide people for providing a great enviroment to program these old machines on. 

Happy Hacking and have a good day.
